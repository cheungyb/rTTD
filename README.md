### Stata codes for illustration of analysis using rTTD and TOS time-scale in COMPASS study:

"COMPASS_rTTD_TOS_Analysis.do" 

### Stata codes for simulation evaluation and comparison of rTTD and TOS:

"rttd_pwlinear.do": Scenarios time-varying covariate has a piecewise linear relation with event hazard.

"rttd_linear.do":   Scenarios time-varying covariate has a linear relation with event hazard.

"rttd_corr.do":     Varying degree of correlation between mortality and event hazards.

"ttd_tcc.do":       Time-constant covariate only; varying correlation between mortality and event hazards.
